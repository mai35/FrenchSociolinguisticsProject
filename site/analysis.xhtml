            <p>Since the entirety of our corpus draws from written (in this case, typed) data, we
                chose to include character count as a potential factor in determining why a French
                speaker would choose to employ an anglicism over alternative lexical variants. We
                decided that character count, for our purposes, is rather comparable to syllable
                count in spoken speech and that functionally-speaking, a speaker would theoretically
                want to choose words that take the least amount of time to type—efficiency being a
                primary motivator in discourse decisions. </p>
            <p>Here, we see that over half of the anglicisms we found fall under the medial category
                of “between 6 and 9 characters,” while roughly one-third consist of between 1 and 5.
                The smallest group, comprising 12.9% of the data, contain 10 or more characters in
                total. </p>
            <p>Adopted English words, then, in general tend to be rather short, and based on the
                measly number of anglicisms within the 10+ category, it is not unreasonable to
                assume that an inversely correlational and possibly causational relationship between
                character count and likelihood to be borrowed does, in fact, exist. Overall, there
                is an 87.1% chance that the borrowed word will fall into one of the first two
                categories, whereas there is only a 12.9% chance that the anglicism will consist of
                more than 9 characters. </p>
            <p>There is, of course, the issue that the majority of words in both English and French
                do not consist of more than 9 characters. Even in the previous sentence, for
                example, the only word that consists of 10+ characters is “characters” itself. To
                know for certain if an individual’s choice is at least partially influenced by
                character count, then, it would become necessary to compare each anglicism to the
                character count of its suggested replacement. For now, missing this data, we can
                offer the idea that such a relationship may exist, but we do not have adequate data
                to say for certain whether or not it does. Such a relationship, among other factors,
                could work to explain a French BuzzFeed user’s decision to employ “hashtag” (7
                characters) over the Académie’s “mot-dièse” (9 characters), among others. </p>

            <p>Like character count, we included syllable count in our analyses in an attempt to
                relate this written data back to the spoken, community object that sociolinguists
                traditionally prefer to study. Syllable count relates back to the linguistic
                efficiency principle—if it can be explained in less time, using fewer words, why
                would we want to make things more difficult for ourselves? Theoretically-speaking,
                then, a speaker should exhibit a preference for words with fewer syllables, and when
                deciding between anglicisms and Académie suggestions, speakers, overall, should
                exhibit a tendency to choose the option with fewer syllables. </p>
            <p>Here, we see that words consisting of 4 or more syllables seem to be highly
                disfavored, and excluding the 1 syllable category, there is a notable inverse
                correlation between word-length and an anglicism’s likelihood to be adopted.
                Overall, based on our data, there is a 94% chance that an anglicism will consist of
                3 syllables or fewer, meanwhile there is only a 6% chance that an anglicism will be
                longer than 3 syllables. </p>
            <p>As is true for the character count analysis, it is possible that these findings
                falsely identify a relationship between these two factors and that the true
                motivator behind these numbers is, in reality, simply a lack of lengthy English
                words available for borrowing. To test the relevance of this correlation, then, it
                would become necessary to extend the current study and directly compare the syllable
                count of each anglicism to that of its corresponding Académie suggestion. </p>

            <p>The overwhelming majority of anglicisms were nouns, which make up 74.8% of our
                results. The next largest categories were adjectives, many of which were derivatives
                of these nouns (i.e. tweeter), at 14.6%, and then verbs at 5.3%. Exclamations,
                abbreviations, interjections and adverbs together made up the remaining 5.9%. </p>
            <p>These results, in general, are not very surprising, as the syntactic category of
                “noun” tends to be the most open to neologisms, and therefore, contains the largest
                pool of lexical items from which other languages may then borrow tokens.
                Additionally, many of these anglicisms are products and inventions, which are
                typically more difficult to translate than a word like “tree,” for example, for
                which French already has a direct correspondent in the form of arbre. Finding French
                equivalents for words like “Sloppy Joe” and “selfie-stick” would unquestionably be
                significantly more difficult, and the resulting translations would likely fail to
                capture the words’ full meanings. </p>
            <h4 id="sa">Semantic Analysis</h4>
            <p>After finding all of the anglicisms within our corpus, we divided them into semantic
                categories. Overall, the largest concentration of tokens seems to fall under “Food”
                at 17.6%, followed by “Media” at 10.7%, and words associated with “Persona/Identity”
                at 9.4%. A possible explanation for these numbers could be the lack of French tokens
                available to use instead. English words for animals, for instance, often have exact
                semantic matches in French (i.e. dog/chien), whereas there are no French equivalents
                for words like “donut” and “mash-up.” One could theoretically choose the French word
                for pastry, “pâte,” over donut, for example, but then listeners would have a harder
                time determining exactly which kind of pastry the speaker means. Choosing to use the
                anglicism in these situations, then, is a functionally logical choice, as the
                anglicism better captures the meaning the speaker wishes to evoke and thus,
                increases conversational clarity. Another possible explanation, which could
                potentially work to explain the usage of anglicisms like “ticket” (French eqv:
                ”billet”), is that there may actually be prestige associated with using anglicisms.
                According to the Pew Research Center’s ongoing “Global Attitudes” project, for
                example, 75% of French citizens have a “favorable” view of the United States. It is
                possible, then, (assuming this number is truly reflective of modern French society),
                that the choice to use an anglicism over its French equivalent may actually, in some
                cases, be a stylistic one. It may be that a positive view of American culture has
                led to a positive view of the English language and that, contrary to what the
                Académie may wish, French speakers now show an affinity for all things American,
                including our language.</p>
            <h4 id="tta">Token-Type Analysis</h4>
            <p>To find the number of anglicisms compared to the total word count, we completed a
                token type analysis, and arrived at 1.45%. Compared to the other studies, such as
                the Bogaards 2008 study of borrowings in French, where researchers found a
                type-token percentage of 2.6%, our number reflects a near 50% decrease. As one of
                the aforementioned downsides of our BuzzFeed corpus is the disproportionately large
                focus on American topics, we would have actually expected to see a number larger
                than 2.6%, not lower. Additionally, many of the anglicisms we found in our data
                (i.e. selfie stick, Instagram, #tbt) did not even enter the English language until
                after 2008, meaning the amount of anglicisms present within French has to have grown
                somewhat since 2008, even if only negligibly. </p><p> Unfortunately, this means that
                it is very likely that the 1.45% figure is incorrect, as this would imply that there
                has been drastic decrease in anglicisms since 2008, while we have data from
                post-2008 suggesting that there has to at least have been some growth. </p></div>
