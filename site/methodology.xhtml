            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p class="other"> To help analyse the usage of various anglicisms, Vicki and Will tagged
                articles from French Buzzfeed. Every anglicism was marked with information
                concerning its part of speech, character count, and syllable count. This information
                will be used to detect any possible patterns regarding which English words and
                suggested replacements are readily accepted into the French language. </p>
            <h4>Mark-Up</h4>
            <p class="other">Using the Python application “Scrapy,” we collected articles from
                Buzzfeed France (buzzfeed.fr). Will and Vicki (our group’s French majors) went
                through each of the articles to check for anglicisms and verified the borrowings’
                etymology using Wiktionary français. Each of the articles was checked twice to
                ensure consistency.</p>
            <p class="other">We marked anglicisms using the tag "anglicisme" and subsequently noted
                each anglicism’s part of speech, syllable count and semantic category. Below is an
                example of a marked anglicism:</p>
            <p id="anglimage"><img src="images/exampleanglicism.png" alt="Example of an Anglicism"
                 /></p>
            <p id="key">Key: *sc= “Syllable Count” pos= “Part of Speech” nom= “Noun” <br />adj=
                “Adjective” verbe= “Verb” abbr= “Abbreviation” <br />*Syllable count was determined
                using the Parisian “chute de ‘e’” (link to read more about this) standard.</p>
            <h3>Etymological Gray Areas</h3>
            <p class="other">Many of the non-French words we encountered were associated with brand
                names, products and movie and television titles, which were decidedly tougher to
                categorize than your standard anglicism, such as “selfie,” for example. Ultimately,
                we decided that brand and title names should not be counted as anglicisms, as the
                decision to translate these terms and phrases is one made by corporations, not the
                general, French-speaking public. Products, by contrast, we decided should be
                considered anglicisms, as, much like any other neologism, speakers use these terms
                creatively. </p>
            <p class="other">Essentially, if the term behaved like a proper noun, we did not count
                it as an anglicism, whereas if the word could be pluralized, preceded by a
                determiner, modified by an adjective etc., it was considered a common noun and
                therefore tagged as an anglicism. Additionally, if the word exhibited any sort of
                change in part of speech, that change was considered evidence that the word had
                undergone creative processes, and that term, too, was added to our list.</p>
            <p class="other">Especially gray terms like “Facebook” were marked differently depending
                on context. In the article (the Mexico one), for instance, the term “Facebook”
                appears multiple times, but of these times, the word is never seen alongside a
                determiner, nor is it pluralized, modified or used creatively. Additionally, in this
                article, we only ever see the term as a hyperlink, meaning, more likely than not,
                these tokens of “Facebook” simply exist to give credit to the company “Facebook,
                Inc.” and are therefore referring to the brand, Facebook, not the product.</p>
            <p class="other">In other cases, however, the term appears to be very much immersed
                within the French language. BuzzFeed users discuss “pages Facebook,” for example,
                where “Facebook” appears to be an adjectival form derived from the original noun
                borrowing. They also use phrases like “mon facebook,” where “mon” is a determiner
                meaning my, and even pluralize the term according to the pluralization rules of
                their language (i.e. “facebooks”). “Facebook” in these contexts, then, seems to
                behave more like a common noun than a proper one. This behavior suggests that a true
                adoption of the term has taken place and that these tokens are in fact
                anglicisms.</p>
            <p class="other">An additional problem we encountered was the surprisingly large number
                of English words of Old French origin that are now being borrowed back into the
                French language. (example) In cases like these, we determined that as long as the
                language from which the word is being borrowed is English, that term should be
                considered an anglicism (i.e. emprunté à l’anglais). ​However, if an entire sentence
                was in English, then it was not considered an anglicism.</p>
