            <h4>What is an anglicism?</h4>
            <p>Simply put, an anglicism is a word or construction borrowed from English into another
                language. Our project will focus on the following types of borrowing:<br /><br />
                <span class="lt">1. Integral borrowing:</span> When an English word is borrowed
                directly into the second language.<br />
                <span class="lt">2. Semantic borrowing:</span> A French word takes on an expanded
                meaning due to contact with English.

            <h4 id="academie">The Académie</h4>
            <p>France is known for being very protective of its language, and even has the Académie
                française, whose mission it is to correct unfavorable speech and keep the French
                language prestigious. Lately this involves discouraging invasive loanwords, many of
                which come from English. We wanted to focus on these anglicisms, and look at the
                Académie's success with promoting their suggested replacements.</p>
            <h4>Corpus</h4>
            <p>We had trouble finding an established French corpus to use that would fit our needs.
                It takes time to create and update a corpus, so the newest additions could be a few
                years old, and we wanted to look at French as it's used right now. We did not want
                to use newspapers or other types of formal writing, because we thought that writers
                of that style would actively avoid anglicisms. We very briefly considered using a
                promising corpus of Quebecois French, but abandoned the idea because Quebecois
                speakers and writers are often very strict about not letting anglicisms creep in, an
                attitude heavily influenced by Quebec being bordered by English-speaking Canada and
                the US.</p>
            <p>We considered using Reddit posts and comments from French subreddits because the
                writing would be informal and from younger people, but the posts are not edited
                professionally, often quite short, and some users are not native French
                speakers.</p>
            <p>We finally decided to use BuzzFeed France as a corpus, because the articles are
                colloquial, professionally edited and written, and written by and for young people,
                who are the most likely to use anglicisms. A benefit of using BuzzFeed articles is
                that they are relatively short, and have a standard format. Occasionally there were
                full-length articles, but most were lists that could be easily marked up in XML. A
                caveat of the corpus is that many of the articles are translated from or based on
                English articles, and many of the topics (especially TV and movies) are
                American.</p>
