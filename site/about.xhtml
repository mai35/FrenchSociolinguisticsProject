            <h4>What is an anglicism?</h4>
            <p>Simply put, an anglicism is a word or construction borrowed from English into another
                language. Our project will focus on integral borrowing, which is when a foreign word
                is borrowed directly into a second language.
                <!--http://site.ebrary.com/lib/pitt/reader.action?docID=10513334-->
            </p>
            <p>When starting this project, we looked at two other studies of loan words in French,
                and both included a number of other languages in addition to English.
                Unsurprisingly, a number of borrowings were from the languages of nearby and
                neighboring countries, like Spain and Italy. In both studies, though, English loan
                words greatly outnumbered loan words from other languages.</p><p>It may be hard for
                English speakers to understand French's aversion to English loanwords at first,
                since English is very accepting of loan words. Unlike in English, though, a sizable
                proportion of borrowings into French come from English, so it is understandable that
                the Académie may see English words as invasive. </p>
            <h4 id="academie">The Académie</h4>
            <p>France is known for being very protective of its language, and even has the Académie
                française, whose mission it is to correct unfavorable speech and keep the French
                language prestigious. Lately this involves discouraging invasive loanwords, many of
                which come from English. We wanted to focus on these anglicisms, and look at the
                Académie's success with promoting their suggested replacements.</p>
            <h4>Corpus</h4>
            <p>We had trouble finding an established French corpus to use that would fit our needs.
                It takes time to create and update a corpus, so the newest additions could be a few
                years old, and we wanted to look at French as it's used right now. We did not want
                to use newspapers or other types of formal writing, because we thought that writers
                of that style would actively avoid anglicisms. We very briefly considered using a
                promising corpus of Quebecois French, but abandoned the idea because Quebecois
                speakers and writers are often very strict about not letting anglicisms creep in, an
                attitude heavily influenced by Quebec being bordered by English-speaking Canada and
                the US.</p>
            <p>We considered using Reddit posts and comments from French subreddits because the
                writing would be informal and from younger people, but the posts are not edited
                professionally, often quite short, and some users are not native French
                speakers.</p>
            <p>We finally decided to use BuzzFeed France as a corpus, because the articles are
                colloquial, professionally edited and written, and written by and for young people,
                who are the most likely to use anglicisms. A benefit of using BuzzFeed articles is
                that they are relatively short, and have a standard format. Occasionally there were
                full-length articles, but most were lists that could be easily marked up in XML. A
                caveat of the corpus is that many of the articles are translated from or based on
                English articles, and many of the topics (especially TV and movies) are
                American.</p>
            <h4>Building the Corpus</h4>
            <p>We could have created our corpus by going to BuzzFeed France and copy and pasting
                articles into XML files, but that would be very tedious. Instead, we used a Python
                program called Scrapy to make a spider (a bot that crawls the web) that gathered
                articles and saved them to out server. With the help of Na-Rae and Andrew, the
                spider was able to bring back only French articles, and bring them back marked up
                with everything we needed except the anglicisms. </p>
            <p>One of the more challenging parts of building the spider was getting it to only
                scrape French articles. Nothing in the URLs indicated what language a BuzzFeed
                article is in, so while we could make the spider stay within BuzzFeed, getting it to
                stay within French BuzzFeed wasn't so easy. French BuzzFeed has links to English
                BuzzFeed, but English BuzzFeed only has links to English BuzzFeed (US, UK,
                Australia, and India). The spider harvests every link on a page, so if one English
                link was harvested it would contaminate the entire corpus.</p>
            <p> By viewing the source code of different-language BuzzFeed pages, Devra was able to
                find something in the HTML of each page that indicated what language it was in. The
                head HTML element of a page has an attribute called "lang." If the page is in
                English, lang will be equal to "en." For German pages, lang=de, and for French pages
                lang=fr.</p>
            <p> Using the lang attribute, Andrew and Devra were able to write an if statement in the
                spider's code that made it only write the contents of an article out to a new file
                if the lang attribute was equal to fr.</p>
