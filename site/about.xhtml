            <h3>What is an anglicism?</h3>
            <p>Simply put, an anglicism is a word or construction borrowed from English into another
                language. Our project will focus on the following types of borrowing:<br /><br />
                <span class="lt">1. Integral borrowing:</span> When an English word is borrowed directly into the second language.<br />
                <span class="lt">2. Semantic borrowing:</span> A French word takes on an expanded meaning due to contact with English.

            <h3 id="academie">The Académie</h3>
            <p>France is known for being very protective of its language, and even has the Académie
                française, whose mission it is to correct unfavorable speech and keep the French
                language prestigious. Lately this involves discouraging invasive loanwords, many of
                which come from English. We wanted to focus on these anglicisms, and look at the
                Académie's success with promoting their suggested replacements.</p>
