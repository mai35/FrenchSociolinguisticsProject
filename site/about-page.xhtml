        <h1>About the Project</h1>
        <h2>The Académie</h2>
        <p>France is known for being very protective of its language, and even has the Académie
            française, whose mission it is to correct unfavorable speech and keep the French
            language prestigious. Lately this involves discouraging invasive loanwords, many of
            which come from English. We wanted to focus on these Anglicisms, and look at the
            Académie's actual influence over French.</p>
