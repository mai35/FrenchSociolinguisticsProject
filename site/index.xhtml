        <p>With the spread of globalization, word exchange between languages has increased. In
            particular, the influx of English loanwords into other languages has been on the rise.
            For over four hundred years, the Académie Francaise, has been making an effort to limit
            the occurrence of English loanwords in French. Have their efforts been successful,
            especially with the new age of increased, immediate communication?</p>
